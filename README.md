# ü§ñ ARM1 Controller ‚Äì ROS 2 Interface for Left-Side Robotic Arm

This repository contains scripts and command-line examples to control the **ARM1**, the left-side robotic arm in a dual-arm setup, using **ROS 2** and **TM Robot drivers**.

The control interface includes robot motion commands as well as IO control for gripper manipulation. It also includes support for remote access via `ngrok`, allowing web-based or remote command forwarding.

## üìÅ Repository Structure


- tmr_ros2/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ laptop_ngrok_controller.py


- `laptop_ngrok_controller.py`: Python script for controlling the left-side arm via ngrok tunnel and issuing commands over ROS 2.

---

## üß† Features

- Move ARM1 to any target 3D pose using ROS 2 services.
- Turn gripper ON/OFF using IO pin commands.
- Remote access setup using `ngrok` for public endpoint exposure.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- ROS 2 installed (tested on ROS 2 Foxy)
- TM Robot SDK / `tm_msgs` package installed
- TM Robot hardware with IP (example: `192.168.11.2`)
- Ngrok (for remote tunnel)

---

## üöÄ Command Line Examples
Notes: TM robot works in degrees, but since ROS normally work in Radians, so we need to convert the degrees to radians first. Also, TM robot works in meters.

    def degrees_to_radians(self, degrees):
        """Convert degrees to radians."""
        return degrees * (math.pi / 180)

    def milimeters_to_meters(self, units):
        return units / 1000


### ‚úÖ Move Robot to Position
```bash
ros2 service call /arm1/set_positions tm_msgs/srv/SetPositions "{motion_type: 4, positions: [0.126893, 0.20437, 0.30512, 2.8103291615612696, -0.007504915783575617, 3.065147232352442], velocity: 0.5, acc_time: 0.5, blend_percentage: 0, fine_goal: true}"
```

‚úÖ Gripper
```bash
ros2 service call /arm1/send_script tm_msgs/srv/SendScript "{id: 'Hucenrotia', script: 'ScriptExit()'}"
```

## üß™ How to run the full system

Terminal 1 ‚Äì Start ngrok Tunnel
```bash
ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:5000
# OR, sorry I forgot which one is the correct one:
ngrok http http://127.0.0.3:9000
```
This exposes your local Flask/ROS server to a public URL via ngrok.

Terminal 2 ‚Äì Launch ROS 2 Driver
```bash
cd ~/gai_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver robot_ip:=192.168.11.2
```
This connects to the TM Robot via its IP and starts the driver.

Terminal 3 ‚Äì Run Control Script
```bash
cd ~/gai_ws/src/tmr_ros2/scripts/script/
source ~/gai_ws/devel/setup.bash
python3 laptop_ngrok_controller.py
```
This Python script connects to ngrok and sends control commands to the arm via ROS services.

Terminal 4 ‚Äì Run the Initial Movement
```bash
cd ~/gai_ws/src/tmr_ros2/scripts/script/
source ~/gai_ws/devel/setup.bash
python3 robot1_init.py
```
This Python script ...


## üìå Notes
1. Make sure your TM Robot is on the same network as your ROS 2 PC.
2. Make sure you are working on the correct directory
